## Fear and Greed

https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/

The fear and greed index is a contrarian index of sorts. It is based on the premise that excessive fear can result in stocks trading well below their intrinsic values, and that unbridled greed can result in stocks being bid up far above what they should be worth. 

CNN examines seven different factors to establish how much fear and greed there is in the market. They are:
Stock Price Momentum: Measuring the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) versus its 125-day moving average (MA)
Stock Price Strength: Calculating the number of stocks hitting 52-week highs versus those hitting 52-week lows on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
Stock Price Breadth: Analyzing trading volumes in rising stocks against declining stocks
Put and Call Options: How much do put options lag behind call options, signifying greed, or surpass them, indicating fear
Junk Bond Demand: Gauging appetite for higher risk strategies by measuring the spread between yields on investment-grade bonds and junk bonds
Market Volatility: CNN measures the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), concentrating on a 50-day MA
Safe Haven Demand: The difference in returns for stocks versus treasuries

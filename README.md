# CNN-Fear-n-Greed-Scraper
If the market is crashing and everyone is afraid, then you should buy stocks.   This script downloads and saves the current CNN Fear and Greed Index at user-defined time intervals. At critical values it sends information mails, which warn you of a market overheating or if there is particularly big panic on the markets.
